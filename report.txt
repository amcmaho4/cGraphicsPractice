how it works from the user perspective

From a users perspective, this is a program that smoothly animates the motion of a cart being pulled side to side by a system of pulleys.The system of pulleys has three rotaters, one large rotater and two smaller rotaters to the left/right and below the larger. These three rotaters along with the cart with wheels are all tied together with a string which pulls the cart between the two smaller rotaters. The ride continuously goes until the user presses the q key.

how the program works internally

	Internally this program is a bit more complicated. It consists of a cart (axis 1) with wheels (axis 2), one large rotating wheel(axis 3), two smaller rotoating wheels (axis 4), and then pulleys linking all of these together (axis 5).The whole program is controlled by a while loop which is controlled by user input. If the user presses 'q' the program will quit. Until this point, the program continuously runs calling makePulleySystem() which takes in the radii of the spinners, the size of the car, and the distance from the edge of the display window.In each iteration of the while loop dx (which controlls the motion of the ride) is incremented/ decremented between 1 pi and 16 pi which allows the cart to move back and forth between the two small spinners.
	makePulleySystem() calls makePulleys() to make the pulleys, makeCart() to make the cart, and makeRotators to make the rotaters. So it creates one axis of motion (the pulleys), but calls the functions to make two more axis of motion (cart and rotaters).makeCart() then obviously makes the cart. So it makes one axis of motion, and it calls the function makeWheels() to make another axis of motion (the wheels of the cart). makeRotaters() makes the large rotater, and then calls the function makeSmallRotaters() to make the smaller rotaters. The wheels and all the rotater funtions call makeWheel() which is a function that uses a for loop to make a wheel with spokes.

how I verified that the output of the program is correct
	I verified that the output of the program was correct by visually checking it. To do this I ran the program. Each time I made changes I would run it and see if I got the desired affect. In the end wanted a pulley system with wheels turning in one direction pulling a cart with wheels spinning the opposite direction. I confirmed that I had gotten this by seeing the three rotaters rotating one direction pulling the cart with wheels spinning in the other direction. I also wanted the pulleys to attatch to the sides of the cart and the sides of the rotaters. I verified this by running the program and seeing that this was the case in the output.I verified the program would quit when I hit 'q' by hiting 'q' and seeing that this did happen.
